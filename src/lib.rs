//! Rust bindings for the `CaDiCaL` SAT Solver, providing low-level access to one of the most efficient Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solving libraries.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! `cadical-sys` offers complete Rust bindings to the `CaDiCaL` SAT solver using the `cxx` crate, enabling seamless interoperability between Rust and C++ SAT solving capabilities.
//!
//! ## What is a SAT Solver?
//!
//! A SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) solver is a computational tool that determines whether there exists an assignment of boolean variables that makes a given boolean formula true. SAT solvers are crucial in:
//! - Formal verification
//! - Hardware design
//! - AI planning
//! - Cryptanalysis
//! - Constraint solving
//!
//! ## About `CaDiCaL`
//!
//! [CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) is a state-of-the-art, modern SAT solver developed by Armin Biere. Known for its:
//! - High performance
//! - Extensive features
//! - Compact implementation
//! - Advanced conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) techniques
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Complete binding of `CaDiCaL` C++ API
//! - Safe Rust wrappers using `cxx` (where possible)
//! - Support for:
//!   - Adding clauses
//!   - Solving boolean satisfiability problems
//!   - Assumption handling
//!   - Advanced solver configuration
//!   - Proof tracing
//!   - Incremental solving
//!
//! # Installation
//!
//! Add to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! cadical-sys = "0.1.0"  # Replace with most recent version
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ## Basic SAT solving example
//! ```rust
//!    use cadical_sys::Status;
//!    use cadical_sys::CaDiCal;
//!
//!    // Create a new solver instance
//!    let mut solver = CaDiCal::new();
//!
//!    // Add clauses (representing a simple propositional logic problem)
//!    // For example, (x1 OR x2) AND (NOT x1 OR x3) AND (NOT x2 OR NOT x3)
//!    solver.clause2(1, 2);    // x1 OR x2
//!    solver.clause2(-1, 3);   // NOT x1 OR x3
//!    solver.clause2(-2, -3);  // NOT x2 OR NOT x3
//!
//!    // Solve the problem
//!    let status = solver.solve();
//!    match status {
//!        Status::SATISFIABLE => {
//!            // Get variable assignments
//!            println!("x1: {}", solver.val(1));
//!            println!("x2: {}", solver.val(2));
//!            println!("x3: {}", solver.val(3));
//!        },
//!        Status::UNSATISFIABLE => println!("No solution exists"),
//!        Status::UNKNOWN => println!("Solution status unknown")
//!    }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Advanced example with assumptions and configuration
//! ```rust
//!    use cadical_sys::Status;
//!    use cadical_sys::CaDiCal;
//!    
//!    let mut solver = CaDiCal::new();
//!
//!    // Configure the solver
//!    solver.configure("plain".to_string());
//!
//!    // Set some options
//!    solver.set("verbose".to_string(), 1);
//!
//!    // Add complex clauses
//!    solver.clause3(1, 2, 3);  // x1 OR x2 OR x3
//!    solver.clause3(-1, -2, -3);  // NOT x1 OR NOT x2 OR NOT x3
//!
//!    // Make assumptions
//!    solver.assume(1);  // Assume x1 is true
//!
//!    // Solve with assumptions
//!    let status = solver.solve();
//!
//!    // Check solving results
//!    if status == Status::SATISFIABLE {
//!        // Interact with solved model
//!        let num_vars = solver.vars();
//!        for var in 1..=num_vars {
//!            println!("Variable {}: {}", var, solver.val(var));
//!        }
//!    }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example of reading DIMACS file and solving
//! ```rust
//!    use cadical_sys::Status;
//!    use cadical_sys::CaDiCal;
//!
//!    let mut solver = CaDiCal::new();
//!    let mut var_count = 0;
//!
//!    // Read a DIMACS CNF file
//!    let result = solver.read_dimacs1(
//!        "./tests/problem.cnf".to_string(),
//!        "my_problem".to_string(),
//!        &mut var_count,
//!        0
//!    );
//!
//!    // Solve the problem from the file
//!    let status = solver.solve();
//!
//!    // Write out results or extension
//!    if status == Status::SATISFIABLE {
//!        solver.write_extension("/tmp/solution.ext".to_string());
//!    }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Demonstrating advanced solver interactions
//! ```rust
//!    use cadical_sys::CaDiCal;
//!
//!    let mut solver = CaDiCal::new();
//!
//!    // Reserve variable space
//!    solver.reserve(1000);
//!
//!    // Add observed variables for tracking
//!    solver.add_observed_var(42);
//!
//!    // Perform simplification
//!    let simplify_status = solver.simplify(2);
//!
//!    // Get solver statistics
//!    solver.statistics();
//!    solver.resources();
//! ```
//!
//! # Performance Considerations
//!
//! - `CaDiCaL` is highly optimized for complex boolean satisfiability problems
//! - Recommended for problems with thousands to millions of variables
//! - Lower overhead compared to many other SAT solvers
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! - Requires understanding of boolean logic and SAT solving
//! - Performance depends on problem complexity
//! - Advanced features require deep knowledge of SAT solving techniques
